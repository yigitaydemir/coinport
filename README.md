# CoinPort

The primary purpose of this application is to provide users with the ability to monitor cryptocurrency prices and assess their historical performance through interactive charts. By signing up with your Google account, you can effortlessly personalize your experience by adding your preferred cryptocurrencies to a designated watchlist.

## Major Features

### ReactJS

The application is developed using ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript framework.

### Coinranking API

Cryptocurrency prices are fetched from the [Coinranking API](https://developers.coinranking.com/api), ensuring real-time and accurate data.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
